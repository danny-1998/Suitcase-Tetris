# Suitcase Tetris
_A project for the High School of Amsterdam and Corendon Dutch Airlines_

### How it all started
In the first year of school, you get a project collaborated with Corendon Dutch Airlines. The goal of the project is that you create a game for the in-flight entertainment system. Teams of 5-6 persons were made. We are free to choose what kind of game we wanted. So we made a lot of concepts to choose from. That varied from a platform slicing game to a flying bird game. Out all of those concepts, we had to choose 3 of them. The one we all decided, was called Suitcase Tetris(name TBD). It was literally like Tetris but kinda reversed. In Tetris you fill the grid to remove layers. In this concept you fill the grid and try to fit everything as much as possible.
